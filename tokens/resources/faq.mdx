  <Accordion title="What is the difference between an ERC-721 and ERC-1155 token?">
    ERC-721 tokens represent unique, one-of-a-kind assets where each token has its own ID and metadata (like an NFT artwork). ERC-1155 tokens are more flexible, allowing both unique (non-fungible) and identical (fungible) assets to exist under one smart contract. This is ideal for gaming items or collections with multiple editions.
