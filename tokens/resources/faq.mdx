  <Accordion title="Are the token contracts audited?">
    Yes, please see the [security](/tokens/resources/security) section for a link to the audit reports.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the difference between an ERC-721 and ERC-1155 token?">
    ERC-721 tokens represent unique, one-of-a-kind assets where each token has its own ID and metadata (like an NFT artwork). ERC-1155 tokens are more flexible, allowing both unique (non-fungible) and identical (fungible) assets to exist under one smart contract. This is ideal for gaming items or collections with multiple editions.

  <Accordion title="How do I renounce ownership of my token contract?">
    You can call the `renounceOwnership` function on your asset contract (e.g., via a block explorer).

    - _Native token value to enter:_ `0`
    - _Note:_ Renouncing ownership is irreversible and means you will no longer be able to update the contract or its metadata.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What are the implications of renouncing ownership?">
    After renouncing ownership, you lose all admin privileges, including the ability to update token metadata or manage contract settings.
