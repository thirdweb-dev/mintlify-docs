## Option 1: MCP Server

The easiest way to enable your agent to **pay for API calls** is by using the **remote MCP server** and supplying the desired tools to your agent.

By default, the MCP server includes **all available tools**. You can limit which tools are exposed by passing a **comma-separated list** of tool names as a query parameter.

In the example below, a **React agent** is created using **LangChain**, with the MCP tools filtered to only include `fetchWithPayment` and `listPayableServices`.

## Option 2: API

You can also **create custom MCP tools**  or wrap external API calls with the `/v1/x402/fetchWithPayment` endpoint to automatically handle payment flows when an API returns a `402 Payment Required` response.

Provide the target **URL** and **HTTP method** when calling the endpoint. By default, it uses your **project wallet** for payments. You can optionally specify a `from` wallet address, either a user wallet or a server wallet, to complete the transaction.
