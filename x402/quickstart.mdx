x402 is an open-source protocol that turns the dormant HTTP 402 Payment Required status code into a fully-featured, on-chain payment layer for APIs, websites, and autonomous agents.

<Tip>
  Learn more about the x402 protocol at [x402.org](https://www.x402.org/)

thirdweb x402 offers integrations both on the client and server side depending on your use case.

    The `wrapFetchWithPayment` utility extends the native `fetch` API to automatically manage **402 Payment Required** responses from any **x402-compatible API**.

    When a payment is required, this wrapper seamlessly handles the entire payment flow using the connected wallet, then retries the request once payment is complete.

    ```javascript
    
    import { wrapFetchWithPayment } from "thirdweb/x402";
    import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
    import { createWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";
    
    const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId: "your-client-id" });
    const wallet = createWallet("io.metamask");
    await wallet.connect({ client });
    
    const fetchWithPay = wrapFetchWithPayment(fetch, client, wallet);
    
    // Make a request that may require payment
    const response = await fetchWithPay(
      "https://api.example.com/paid-endpoint",
    );
    ```

    This approach allows your frontend to interact with paid endpoints without needing custom payment-handling logic.

    For more examples and configuration details, refer to the [Client-side Integration Guide](/x402/x402-client).

    To make your API endpoints payable, use the `settlePayment` function within your server route or middleware. This function verifies and settles incoming x402 payments before executing your business logic.

    ```javascript
    import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
    import { facilitator, settlePayment } from "thirdweb/x402";
    import { arbitrumSepolia } from "thirdweb/chains";
    
    const client = createThirdwebClient({ secretKey: "your-secret-key" });
    const thirdwebX402Facilitator = facilitator({
      client,
      serverWalletAddress: "0xYourWalletAddress",
    });
    
    export async function GET(request: Request) {
      const paymentData = request.headers.get("x-payment");
    
      const result = await settlePayment({
        resourceUrl: "https://api.example.com/premium-content",
        method: "GET",
        paymentData,
        payTo: "0xYourWalletAddress",
        network: arbitrumSepolia,
        price: "$0.01",
        facilitator: thirdwebX402Facilitator,
        routeConfig: {
          description: "Access to premium API content",
          mimeType: "application/json",
          maxTimeoutSeconds: 300,
        },
      });
    
      if (result.status === 200) {
        return Response.json({ data: "premium content" });
      } else {
        return Response.json(result.responseBody, {
          status: result.status,
          headers: result.responseHeaders,
        });
      }
    }
    ```

    You can also abstract this logic into reusable middleware to handle payments across multiple endpoints. The configured **facilitator** is responsible for verifying and settling payments onchain using your server wallet. 

    For more examples and configuration details, refer to the [Server-side Integration Guide](/x402/x402-server).
