The facilitator is a service that handles verifying and submitting x402 payments. It uses your own [server wallet](https://portal.thirdweb.com/wallets/server) and leverages EIP-7702 to submit transactions gaslessly.

**How it works**:

- **Verification** - Validates payment signatures and requirements
- **Settlement** - Submits the payment transaction on-chain
- **Gasless** - Uses [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702) for gasless transactions
- **Your Wallet** - Uses your own server wallet for receiving payments

## **Chain and token support**

thirdweb facilitator supports payments on any EVM chain, as long as the payment token supports either:

- ERC-2612 permit (most ERC20 tokens)
- ERC-3009 sign with authorization (USDC on all chains)
