thirdweb AI supports two transaction modes: **Auto Execute** or **Prepare for Signing**

- **Auto Execute**: The API will auto execute the transaction and requires wallet authentication.
- **Prepare for Signing**: The API will only prepare the transaction for signing. The user will need to sign the transaction manually.

    **Requirements:**

    The context object must be set with:

    - `from` set to the wallet address to execute the transaction from
    - `auto_execute_transaction` set to `true`
    - (Optional) `chain_ids` set to the chain IDs to execute the transaction on

    The API must be called with either:

    - your `x-secret-key` header for server wallet authentication
    - OR a `Authorization` header with a valid wallet JWT for user wallet authentication

**Model behavior:**

If all the requirements are met, the transaction will be executed automatically and the model will return a message with the transaction ID.

It will also include an `actions` array with a `monitor_transaction` action. This action can be used to monitor the transaction status and get the transaction receipt via the thirdweb API.
