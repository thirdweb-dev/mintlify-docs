**Onramp Providers** are services that allow users to buy crypto with fiat.

Bridge integrates the following onramp providers:

- [**Coinbase**](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/onramp-&-offramp/introduction/welcome)
- [**Transak**](https://transak.com/)
- [**Stripe**](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/onramp)

## Provider Fees & Regions

Each provider sets its own fees, which may vary based on several factors. These fees are determined solely by the onramp provider and are not controlled or influenced by thirdweb.

Each provider also has different regions and currencies they support.
