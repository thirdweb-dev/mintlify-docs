Gas sponsorship lets you pay transaction fees for your users. They sign transactions with zero friction—no need to hold native tokens for gas.

## What is it?

Normally, users need ETH (or the native token) to pay gas fees. With gas sponsorship, you cover those costs. Users can interact with your contracts without worrying about gas.

Perfect for onboarding new users who don't own crypto yet.

## How it works

Gas sponsorship uses smart account technology:

- **EIP-7702** (recommended) - Simpler, works with regular wallets
- **ERC-4337** - Account abstraction standard

Both methods let you sponsor gas fees. Enable it when creating user wallets, and transactions from those wallets get sponsored automatically.

The user still signs each transaction—you just pay the gas fee.

## What gets sponsored?

You can sponsor:

- **Contract interactions** - Minting NFTs, claiming tokens, game actions
- **Token transfers** - Sending ERC-20 tokens
- **Any on-chain transaction** - As long as it originates from a sponsored wallet

## Control your spending

Configure sponsorship rules from your thirdweb dashboard:

### Scope rules

- **Specific contracts** - Only sponsor your own contracts
- **Specific functions** - Only sponsor certain operations (like `mint` but not `transfer`)
- **Specific chains** - Sponsor on Polygon but not Ethereum

### Budget limits

- **Per user** - Cap gas spending per wallet
- **Per day/month** - Set overall spending limits
- **Alert thresholds** - Get notified when approaching limits

## Common use cases

- **Onboarding** - New users don't need to buy crypto to get started
- **Gaming** - Players focus on gameplay, not managing gas
- **Social apps** - Users post, like, share without friction
- **NFT minting** - Let users mint without needing ETH first
- **Loyalty programs** - Reward users without them paying gas to claim

## Cost considerations

Gas sponsorship costs you real money—you're paying network fees. Start with:

1. Restrictive rules (specific contracts and functions only)
2. Low per-user limits
3. Test on cheaper networks first (Base, Polygon)

Monitor spending in your dashboard and adjust rules as needed.
