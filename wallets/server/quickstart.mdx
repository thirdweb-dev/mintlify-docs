Server wallets are wallets managed by your backend. Use them for admin actions, treasury management, or any transaction that originates from your server instead of your users.

## What are they?

Server wallets are non-custodial wallets that live on your backend. You control them completely—use them for:

- **Treasury wallets** - Hold and manage your project's funds
- **Admin wallets** - Execute privileged contract operations
- **Automation** - Send transactions programmatically

## How it works

### 1. Create a server wallet

Create server wallets via the API by passing an identifier (any string, but use a descriptive name like "treasury-wallet" or "admin-wallet").

You'll get back a wallet address. Save it—you'll use it to send transactions.

### 2. Send transactions

All transactions go through the API. Specify your server wallet address as the `from` field, and thirdweb handles signing and sending.

You can:

- **Send native tokens** (ETH, MATIC, etc.)
- **Interact with smart contracts** (mint NFTs, transfer tokens, call any function)
- **Batch transactions** together
- **Monitor transaction status** via API or webhooks

### 3. Manage wallets

List all your server wallets to see their addresses and identifiers. Create new ones as needed for different purposes (treasury, admin, automation, etc.).

## Common use cases

- **NFT minting** - Mint NFTs to users from your backend
- **Airdrops** - Distribute tokens programmatically
- **Contract administration** - Update contract settings, pause/unpause
- **Automated trading** - Execute trades based on bot logic
- **Reward distribution** - Send rewards based on user actions

## Security

Server wallets are managed by thirdweb's secure infrastructure. Your secret key controls access—keep it safe and never expose it client-side.

Each wallet is fully non-custodial. thirdweb handles the infrastructure but you maintain full control via your API keys.
