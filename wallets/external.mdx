External wallets let users connect with wallets they already own—MetaMask, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, and 500+ others.

## What are they?

Instead of creating a new wallet for users, you let them connect their existing browser extension or mobile wallet. thirdweb supports all EIP-6963 compatible wallets plus native integrations for popular wallets.

## When to use external wallets

Use external wallets when:

- Your users are crypto-native and already have wallets
- You want to give users the choice to bring their own wallet
- You need to support hardware wallets or specific wallet apps

For mainstream users who don't have wallets yet, use [user wallets](/wallets/user) instead.

## Supported wallets

thirdweb supports 500+ wallets including:

- **MetaMask**
- **Coinbase Wallet**
- **Rainbow**
- **Trust Wallet**
- **WalletConnect** - connects to 400+ mobile wallets
- **All EIP-6963 compatible wallets** - automatic detection

## How it works

When you add external wallet support:

1. thirdweb detects which wallets are installed in the user's browser
2. User selects their wallet from the available options
3. They approve the connection in their wallet app
4. Your app can now send transactions that the user signs in their wallet

## Mix and match

You can offer both embedded user wallets and external wallets at the same time. This gives users flexibility:

- Crypto beginners can use embedded wallets (no setup required)
- Crypto-native users can connect their existing wallets
