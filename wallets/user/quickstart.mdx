User wallets are embedded in-app wallets that live inside your application. Each user gets their own non-custodial wallet automatically—no seed phrases, no browser extensions.

## What are they?

When a user logs into your app, thirdweb creates a wallet for them behind the scenes. The user doesn't need to download anything or manage private keys. It just works.

## How it works

1. **User authenticates** - They log in using one of the supported auth methods
2. **Wallet gets created** - thirdweb generates a wallet tied to their identity
3. **User transacts** - The wallet can now send transactions, sign messages, interact with contracts

## Auth methods

- **Social logins** - Google, Apple, Facebook, Discord, etc.
- **Email or SMS** - Passwordless verification
- **Passkeys** - Biometric authentication
- **Bring your own auth** - Connect wallets to your existing user system

## What can users do?

Once they have a wallet, users can:

- Send and receive tokens
- Interact with smart contracts
- Sign messages
- Use the wallet across any chain you support

All transactions still require the user's signature—thirdweb never has custody of their assets.

## Next steps

- **[Ecosystem Wallets](/wallets/ecosystem)** - Unlock advanced features like cross-app wallets and partner integrations
- **[External Wallets](/wallets/external)** - Let users connect their existing wallets (MetaMask, Rainbow, etc.)
