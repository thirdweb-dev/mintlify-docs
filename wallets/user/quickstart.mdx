User Wallets are the wallets you attach to user authentication.

thirdweb supports various authentication methods by default: social logins, email, SMS, passkeys, and more. For every user, thirdweb generates a non-custodial wallet behind the scenes.

You can even bring your own authentication and provision a wallet based on your own user IDs.
