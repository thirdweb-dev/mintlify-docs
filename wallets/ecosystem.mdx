Ecosystem wallets are user wallets with additional functionality unlocked. Same tech, more features.

## What makes them different?

Ecosystem wallets are built on the same technology as regular user wallets, but they let you:

- **Share wallets across apps** - Users keep the same wallet across your entire ecosystem of apps and games
- **Partner integrations** - Let approved partners integrate your wallet into their apps
- **Centralized management** - Control permissions, gas sponsorship, and branding from one dashboard

Think of it as upgrading from a single-app wallet to a multi-app wallet system.

## When to use ecosystem wallets

Use ecosystem wallets if you:

- Have multiple apps or games where users should share the same wallet
- Want to let partners integrate your branded wallet
- Need centralized control over your entire wallet ecosystem

If you just need wallets for a single app, stick with regular [user wallets](/wallets/user).

## How to set up

### 1. Create your ecosystem

Visit the [Ecosystem Wallets dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/team/~/~/ecosystem/create) and name your ecosystem. This name is permanent and appears wherever your wallet shows up.

You'll get an **Ecosystem ID** - save this, you'll need it for integration.

### 2. Set permissions

Choose who can use your ecosystem wallet:

**Anyone** - Open to all apps (you can blocklist bad actors)  
**Allowlist** - Restrict to approved partners only

For allowlist mode, add each app with:

- App name
- Allowed domains
- Bundle ID (for mobile apps)

Each approved app gets a **Partner ID**.

### 3. Integrate and use

Reference your Ecosystem ID in your integration. For allowlist mode, also include your Partner ID.

All the same auth methods from user wallets work here—the wallet just has additional cross-app capabilities enabled.

## What you can do

- **Cross-app authentication** - User logs in once, works everywhere
- **Shared wallet balance** - Same wallet address across all your apps
- **Partner management** - Add/remove apps from your dashboard
- **Gas sponsorship** - Sponsor transactions for your entire ecosystem

Check the API Reference tab for implementation details.
